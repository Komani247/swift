== TODO

* Type casting! I've been putting this one off for ages.
* Cache insert, update, get query statements.
* Identity map.
* Key handling needs to be cleaner. Perhaps bring back Keys and Properties sets?
* Assertions for dumb stuff. model < Model for methods in Adapter.
* Profile. Start moving slow (and easy) stuff to extension.
* Benchmark against DM (is it worth even looking at AR?).
